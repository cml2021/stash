# Stash

I'm a weirdo who likes to listen to podcasts while I exercise. Often I'll be in the middle of a workout or a run when I hear a book recommendation that sounds interesting or someone mentions a movie I want to check out. I want a quick way to capture or "stash" these items for later in a more organized fashion than in a general purpose notes app. That's why I'm building Stash. 

My plan is to build Stash as a React Native mobile-first application with a NodeJS backend. Currently, I'm working on setting up the backend infrastructure and initial API endpoints. 

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* Docker Desktop

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

2. Start Docker Desktop
